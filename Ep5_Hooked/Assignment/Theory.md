**1. Difference between Named export, Default export, and * as export?**
- **Named export:** Named exports allow you to export multiple values from a module and import them using the corresponding names. You can have multiple named exports in a single module, and when importing, you need to use curly braces `{}` to specify the exported names.

Example:
```javascript
// module.js
export const foo = 42;
export const bar = "hello";

// another file
import { foo, bar } from './module.js';
```

- **Default export:** Default export allows you to export a single value from a module without giving it a specific name. You can have only one default export per module, and when importing, you can choose any name for the imported value.

Example:
```javascript
// module.js
const myDefault = "default value";
export default myDefault;

// another file
import myAlias from './module.js';
```

- **\* as export:** The `* as` syntax is used to import all exports from a module into a single namespace (object). It is useful when you want to import multiple values from a module without knowing their specific names.

Example:
```javascript
// module.js
export const foo = 42;
export const bar = "hello";

// another file
import * as myModule from './module.js';
console.log(myModule.foo); // 42
console.log(myModule.bar); // "hello"
```

**2. Importance of config.js file?**
A `config.js` file is often used to centralize and manage configuration settings and environment variables for an application. It allows developers to define various settings, such as API endpoints, authentication tokens, feature toggles, and other runtime configurations, in one place. This approach promotes maintainability, as changes to configuration settings can be made in a single file rather than scattered throughout the codebase. Additionally, it provides a way to manage different configurations for development, staging, and production environments, simplifying the deployment process.

**3. What are React Hooks?**
React Hooks are functions introduced in React 16.8 that allow functional components to have state and lifecycle features that were previously only available in class components. Hooks provide a way to use React features, such as state management, lifecycle methods, context, and more, without writing a class. They encourage code reuse, modularity, and better organization of logic within functional components.

**4. Why do we need a useState Hook?**
The `useState` Hook is one of the most commonly used React Hooks. It enables functional components to have stateful behavior by adding local state management. With `useState`, you can initialize and update state within a functional component without converting it to a class component. It simplifies the process of handling state and re-renders in React applications, making the code more concise and easier to understand. By using `useState`, developers can avoid the complexities of managing state using traditional class-based components and lifecycle methods.
