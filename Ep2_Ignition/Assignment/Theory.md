**1. What is NPM?**
NPM (Node Package Manager) is a package manager for Node.js and JavaScript. It is used to install, manage, and share open-source code packages written in JavaScript. NPM comes bundled with Node.js, allowing developers to easily download and use external libraries, frameworks, and tools in their projects.

**2. What is Parcel/Webpack? Why do we need it?**
Parcel and Webpack are both popular build tools, also known as bundlers. They are used to bundle, optimize, and prepare web application assets (JavaScript, CSS, images, etc.) for production deployment. These bundlers handle tasks like transpiling modern JavaScript code, minification, and code splitting, resulting in optimized and efficient production-ready code.

**3. What is .parcel-cache?**
The `.parcel-cache` directory is used by the Parcel bundler to cache compiled assets. It stores intermediate results to speed up subsequent builds by avoiding recompilation of unchanged files. The cache helps improve build performance and reduces processing time.

**4. What is npx?**
`npx` is a tool that comes with NPM (Node Package Manager) starting from version 5.2.0. It allows developers to run Node.js packages directly without installing them globally. This is particularly useful for running command-line tools or one-off scripts without polluting the global package space.

**5. What is the difference between dependencies vs devDependencies?**
Dependencies and devDependencies are two sections in the `package.json` file used to manage project dependencies:
- `dependencies`: This section lists the packages required for the application to run in the production environment.
- `devDependencies`: This section lists the packages required during development and build processes but not needed to run the application in production. Common examples include testing frameworks, build tools, and development-specific utilities.

**6. What is tree shaking?**
Tree shaking is a technique used by bundlers like Webpack and Parcel to eliminate dead code from the final bundle. It identifies and removes unused code from modules, reducing the bundle size and optimizing performance.

**7. What is hot module replacement?**
Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is a feature provided by bundlers like Webpack and Parcel. It allows developers to apply code changes during development without requiring a full page refresh. HMR updates the modules that have changed without losing the application's current state, resulting in a faster development feedback loop.

**8. List down 5 responsibilities of Parcel and describe any 3 of them:**
   - Bundling: Parcel bundles and packages assets like JavaScript, CSS, and images for web applications.
   - Code Transformation: It supports modern JavaScript features and automatically applies necessary transformations for compatibility with older browsers.
   - Hot Module Replacement: Parcel provides built-in support for HMR, enabling real-time updates during development.
   - Asset Optimization: It optimizes assets, like minification and compression, to improve application performance.
   - Dependency Resolution: Parcel automatically resolves and installs dependencies required by the project.

**9. What is .gitignore? What should we add and not add into it?**
`.gitignore` is a file used to specify which files and directories should be excluded from version control when using Git. It is used to avoid tracking unnecessary files, build artifacts, and sensitive information. Developers should add files like `node_modules`, build output folders, and credentials to the `.gitignore` file.

**10. What is the difference between package.json and package-lock.json?**
`package.json` contains metadata and configuration for a Node.js project, including the list of dependencies and devDependencies. `package-lock.json` is automatically generated when dependencies are installed and locks down the specific versions of the installed packages, ensuring consistency across different environments.

**11. Why should I not modify package-lock.json?**
Modifying `package-lock.json` directly is discouraged because it is automatically generated and managed by NPM. Manually editing it can lead to inconsistencies and conflicts in the package versions, potentially causing unexpected behavior in the project.

**12. What is node_modules? Is it a good idea to push that on git?**
`node_modules` is a directory that contains all the installed dependencies for a Node.js project. It is not necessary to push `node_modules` to Git because it can be easily regenerated by running `npm install` based on the information in `package.json` and `package-lock.json`. Pushing `node_modules` would bloat the repository and make cloning the project slower.

**13. What is dist folder?**
The `dist` (short for distribution) folder typically contains the final output files generated after building a project. It usually includes minified and optimized assets ready for deployment to production.

**14. What is browserlist?**
`browserslist` is a configuration file used to specify the list of target browsers and their versions that a project should support. It is used by various tools, like Autoprefixer, to determine which CSS prefixes to include based on the specified browser compatibility
